Problem 1: Multiplication Table
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. Then, using a for loop, 
print the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.

Problem 2: Guess the Number
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 
20 (you can set this manually as number = 12 for simplicity). 
The program should ask the user to guess the number. Use a while 
loop to keep asking until they guess correctly. If the guess is too high, 
output "Too high!" If the guess is too low, output "Too low!" When they guess correctly, 
print "Congratulations! You've guessed the number."

Problem 3: Even or Odd Counter
Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer. 
Then, using a for loop, count how many even numbers and how many 
odd numbers there are from 1 up to the entered number. Print out the counts of each.

Problem 4: Countdown Timer
Write a program that asks the user for a starting number. 
Then, using a while loop, count down from that number to 0, 
printing each number. When the countdown reaches 0, print "Blast off!"

Problem 5: Password Checker
Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. 
Using a while loop, keep asking for the password until they 
enter the correct one (you can set the password as "password123" 
in your code). If they enter it incorrectly, print "Wrong password, try again."

Problem 6: Sum of Numbers
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. 
Then, using a for loop, calculate the sum of all numbers 
from 1 up to the entered number. Print the final sum.
